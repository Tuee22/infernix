## Status Vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Done` | Implemented, validated, docs aligned, no remaining work |
| `Active` | Partially implemented; remaining work is explicit |
| `Blocked` | Waiting on named prerequisites |
| `Planned` | Ready to start; dependencies are already satisfied |

## Definition of Done

A phase or sprint can move to `Done` only when all of the following are true:

1. The listed implementation paths exist in the current worktree.
2. The listed validation gates pass on the supported execution path or matrix.
3. The governed docs named in `Docs to update` match the implementation.
4. No remaining cleanup or compatibility surface is left unstated.
5. Cleanup promised by the sprint is reflected in
   [legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md](legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md).

## Current Repo Assessment

Phases 0 through 6 close around the implemented worktree. The repository implements the
staged-substrate architecture, the baked Linux outer-container launcher,
the mandatory HA platform services, the Gateway-owned routed edge, the shared Python adapter
project, the Haskell-owned browser-contract generation path, the substrate-specific validation
surface, and the final Apple split-executor topology described below. The Apple lane deploys
cluster `infernix service` daemons for
request-topic consumption and host-batch handoff while same-binary host daemons consume the
configured host batch topic, execute Apple-native inference, and publish completed results.

The repository implements the substrate-file doctrine described by this plan. Supported flows
stage one `infernix-substrate.dhall` beside the active build root through the `infernix` command
that needs it; the explicit
`infernix internal materialize-substrate ...` helpers remain the direct restaging or inspection
surface. The Linux substrate Dockerfile also materializes a build-arg-selected substrate file
inside the image overlay during image build, but supported Compose runs bind-mount the host
`./.build/` tree over that location and therefore rely on the binary-owned host-visible staging
path before lifecycle or aggregate test commands. Focused `infernix lint ...` and
`infernix docs check` remain substrate-file independent. The final substrate payload also
distinguishes cluster and host daemon
roles: cluster-role configs name the substrate, request and result topics, and any Apple
host-inference batch topic, while host-role Apple configs include the routed Pulsar connection
details and the batch topic consumed by the host daemon. Cluster publication mirrors the
cluster-role payload locally under
`./.data/runtime/configmaps/infernix-demo-config/infernix-substrate.dhall` and mounts the same
filename inside cluster workloads at `/opt/build/infernix-substrate.dhall`, while the Apple host
file under `./.build/` remains host-role metadata for the same substrate. The file is a typed
Dhall record at `infernix-substrate.dhall`, decoded in-process by the `dhall` Haskell library.
`infernix test all`
runs the full supported validation suite for the active built substrate; full repository substrate
closure comes from separate governed reruns for `apple-silicon`, `linux-cpu`, and `linux-gpu`,
not from one implicit cross-substrate matrix invocation. The generated file, `cluster status`,
publication JSON, and generated browser contracts still serialize that active substrate under
`runtimeMode` field names. `cluster status` does not mutate Kubernetes resources, publication
state, or authoritative repo-local state; the accepted Linux outer-container exception is an
idempotent Docker network membership repair that attaches the fresh launcher container to the
private `kind` network for observation. The Apple split-executor contract
is implemented on `apple-silicon`: `cluster up` keeps Harbor, MinIO, Pulsar,
PostgreSQL, Envoy Gateway, the optional clustered `infernix-demo` surface, and cluster
`infernix service` daemons in Kind; those cluster daemons own request-topic consumption and
host-batch handoff but do not execute Apple-native inference or publish the completed result;
same-binary host daemons consume the host batch topic, run the Apple-native inference engine, and
publish the result. On `linux-cpu` and `linux-gpu`, the cluster daemons read from Pulsar, run
inference directly, and publish results. The generated final-phase Helm values currently run one
cluster `infernix service` replica; the chart template exposes `service.replicaCount` and preferred
anti-affinity for explicit multi-replica values. Pulsar-owned topics, exclusive subscriptions, and
acknowledgement handling are the ordering and ownership boundary for request handoff, inference,
and result publication if operators deliberately scale that surface. The current adapters emit
deterministic engine-family output from
typed durable metadata, while unsupported adapter ids fail
fast instead of falling through to a generic success path. The worktree omits the
direct Harbor, MinIO, and Pulsar tool-route compatibility handlers, requires the real routed
upstream behavior in integration, and persists Linux cluster state before later rollout phases.
Bootstrap shells no longer restage the active substrate payload before lifecycle commands; that
preflight belongs to the binary command that needs the file. The formatter-toolchain closure
remains in place: the Haskell style bootstrap drives `ormolu` and
`hlint` through the dedicated compatible formatter compiler `ghc-9.12.4`, while the Linux
substrate image preinstalls that compiler beside the project `ghc-9.14.1` toolchain. The
supported Linux outer-container launcher reuses a persistent `chart/charts/` archive cache,
hydrates the MinIO dependency through the supported direct tarball path instead of Docker
Hub-backed OCI metadata, and detects the known stale Pulsar or ZooKeeper epoch mismatch by
resetting only the retained Pulsar claim roots and retrying `cluster up` once. The Apple
clean-host bootstrap verifies the selected ghcup-managed `ghc` and `cabal` executables before
direct `cabal install`, reconciles Homebrew `protoc`, reconciles Colima to the supported
`8 CPU / 16 GiB` profile before Docker-backed work, and lets Apple adapter setup or validation
paths reconcile the Homebrew-managed `python@3.12` formula and `python3.12` command plus a
user-local Poetry bootstrap on demand. The Poetry bootstrap may reuse an already available
compatible Python 3.12+ executable when one passes the implemented version check. Routed Apple
Playwright readiness probes `127.0.0.1` from the host while the browser container joins the
private Docker `kind` network and targets the Kind control-plane DNS, and the dedicated
Playwright image no longer bakes a conflicting `NO_COLOR` default. The shared cluster lifecycle
now surfaces explicit in-progress phase, child-operation detail, and heartbeat data through
`cluster status` during monitored Docker build, Harbor publication, Harbor-backed final-image
preload, and Apple retained-state replay steps; explicit substrate materialization writes the
staged `infernix-substrate.dhall` atomically so concurrent status readers do not observe truncated
payloads; and retained-state Apple reruns automatically reinitialize stopped Harbor PostgreSQL
replicas from the current Patroni leader when timeline drift leaves replicas unready after
promotion. The shared lifecycle skips broad pre-Harbor support-image preloads and follows the
stricter Harbor-first target where only Harbor-required services may pull upstream before Harbor
is responsive and every remaining image, including the active `infernix` runtime image, is loaded
into Harbor before final rollout. Phase 6
records clean governed bootstrap reruns for `linux-cpu`,
`linux-gpu`, and the supported Apple lifecycle, including Apple reruns on
May 15, 2026 and May 17, 2026 through `./bootstrap/apple-silicon.sh doctor`, `build`, `up`,
`status`, `test`, `down`, and final `status`, plus the May 19, 2026 post-warning-cleanup
`linux-gpu` rerun through `./bootstrap/linux-gpu.sh doctor`, forced image refresh, `build`, `up`,
`status`, `test`, `down`, `purge`, and final `status`. Those reruns validated the split daemon
topology, host-batch Pulsar handoff, routed Playwright E2E, repeated retained-state cluster
bring-up or teardown cycles inside the governed `test` lane, and final post-teardown status
returning `clusterPresent: False`,
`lifecycleStatus: idle`, and `lifecyclePhase: cluster-absent`. Those reruns also validate
the Harbor publication closure for repo-owned local images: publication pushes the
`infernix-linux-cpu:local` payload before third-party chart dependencies and re-tags the source
image before each bounded push retry, so retry recovery does not depend on a previously retained
target tag. The earlier May 13 lifecycle investigation remains the proof point that
`build-cluster-images` can remain healthy well past thirty minutes before Harbor publication
begins and that Harbor image pushes are readiness-gated with bounded retries across transient
registry resets. Sprint 6.26 closes the buildx, npm, GHCup shell-profile, Python packaging, and
Playwright image-script warning cleanup with the governed `linux-gpu` lifecycle rerun complete.
Sprint 6.27 closes the staged-substrate format cleanup: `infernix-substrate.dhall` is now a real
typed Dhall record decoded in-process by the `dhall` Haskell library, with the schema documented at
`dhall/InfernixSubstrate.dhall`.

The production and routed validation path uses real Pulsar transport. The repository still keeps
the repo-local topic spool under `./.data/runtime/pulsar/` as a deliberate harness surface when
unit-level checks or manually isolated daemon runs intentionally omit Pulsar endpoint
configuration; that harness does not count as routed cluster evidence and does not replace the
Gateway-backed Pulsar assertions in integration or E2E validation.

Monitoring is not a supported first-class surface.

## Execution Contexts and Substrates

The plan keeps these concepts separate:

| Concept | Values | Meaning |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Control-plane execution context | Apple host-native, Linux outer-container | where `infernix` runs |
| Supported substrate | `apple-silicon`, `linux-cpu`, `linux-gpu` | which staged `infernix-substrate.dhall` payload the active build root carries |

### Naming Note

The canonical NVIDIA-backed Linux substrate id is `linux-gpu`, and the implementation plus docs
now use that id consistently.

## Canonical Outcome

The supported platform now closes around these rules:

- two repo-owned Haskell executables share the default Cabal library exposed by the `infernix`
  package (declared in `infernix.cabal` without an explicit library name and depended on as
  `infernix`): `infernix` for the production daemon, cluster lifecycle, validation, and internal
  helpers; `infernix-demo` for the routed demo HTTP host
- one Haskell command registry owns parsing, help text, and the
  canonical CLI reference, but it no longer exposes `--runtime-mode` or any equivalent substrate
  override
- the product contract standardizes three substrates:
  `apple-silicon`, `linux-cpu`, and `linux-gpu`
- the active substrate is read from the staged `infernix-substrate.dhall` file beside the active
  build root, and that staged payload is the primary source of truth for substrate identity,
  generated catalog content, daemon role, inference placement, Pulsar topics, and test scope
- Apple host-native lifecycle and validation commands materialize or verify
  `./.build/infernix-substrate.dhall`; the explicit helper
  `./.build/infernix internal materialize-substrate apple-silicon [--demo-ui true|false]`
  remains available for direct restaging or inspection
- Linux outer-container lifecycle and validation commands materialize or verify
  `./.build/outer-container/build/infernix-substrate.dhall` on the host through the bind-mounted
  build tree; the explicit helper
  `docker compose run --rm infernix infernix internal materialize-substrate <runtime-mode> --demo-ui <true|false>`
  remains available for direct restaging or inspection
- the Linux substrate Dockerfile materializes a build-arg-selected copy inside the image overlay,
  but the supported outer-container command surface bind-mounts the host `./.build/` tree, so
  lifecycle and aggregate test commands materialize or verify the host-visible substrate file
  before doing substrate-aware work
- supported runtime, cluster, cache, Kubernetes-wrapper, frontend-contract generation, and
  aggregate `infernix test ...` entrypoints own substrate-file preflight for their execution
  context and fail with a substrate-specific diagnostic if the file cannot be materialized or
  validated; focused `infernix lint ...` and `infernix docs check` remain substrate-file independent
- the staged substrate file is a typed Dhall record at `infernix-substrate.dhall`, materialized by
  Haskell runtime helpers and decoded in-process by the `dhall` Haskell library; the schema lives
  at `dhall/InfernixSubstrate.dhall`
- Apple host-native operation is the only supported host build path outside a container
- on Apple Silicon, the host-built `./.build/infernix` binary manages Kind, deploys the mandatory
  cluster support services, the cluster `infernix service` Deployment, and optional routed demo
  workload, and owns the host-side same-binary inference daemon lane
- on Apple Silicon, the cluster daemon is canonical for Pulsar ingress and host-batch handoff,
  while the host daemon is canonical for Apple-native inference execution and result publication;
  both roles consume `.dhall` role config from the same binary family
- when the demo UI is enabled on Apple Silicon, the routed demo surface stays cluster-resident and
  manual inference flows through the cluster daemon's batching path before Apple inference batches
  move through Pulsar to host daemons
- on Apple Silicon, Compose is not a user-facing launcher for ordinary CLI work; the host CLI
  invokes `docker compose run --rm playwright` against the dedicated `infernix-playwright:local`
  image for routed Playwright E2E
- on Linux substrates, all supported CLI commands run through
  `docker compose run --rm infernix infernix ...`; there is no supported Linux host-native build or
  CLI surface outside the outer container
- `linux-cpu` is the only substrate that remains meaningfully portable across unrelated host
  hardware; Apple operators may exercise it through Colima's amd64 VM, and arm64 Linux is treated
  as a first-class CPU-only host shape
- `linux-gpu` assumes an amd64 Linux environment paired with a CUDA-capable device, but the outer
  control-plane container itself does not require the NVIDIA runtime
- for `linux-gpu`, the outer control-plane image is still built from the CUDA base image, and that
  same built image is the artifact pushed to Harbor and deployed as the cluster daemon
- the staged substrate file lives under the active build root:
  `./.build/infernix-substrate.dhall` on Apple and `./.build/outer-container/build/infernix-substrate.dhall`
  on the host on the Linux outer-container path; cluster deployment republishes that payload
  through `ConfigMap/infernix-demo-config` whenever the active topology has cluster-resident
  consumers and mounts the same filename inside those workloads at `/opt/build/infernix-substrate.dhall`
- each daemon reads its staged substrate `.dhall` at startup; automatic file-watching or reload is
  not part of the supported contract
- the supported materialization path can emit `demo_ui = false` with
  `--demo-ui false`; omitting that flag keeps the default demo-enabled output
- the routed demo app remains cluster-resident when enabled, and the Apple routed path closes
  around an explicit cluster-daemon-to-host-daemon inference batch bridge rather than
  cluster-resident Apple inference execution
- supported entrypoints no longer carry the old cross-substrate default matrix, cluster bring-up
  fallbacks, direct tool-route compatibility handlers, or generic inference-success fallback;
  routed Harbor, MinIO, and Pulsar checks require the real Gateway-backed upstream behavior, while
  inference coverage goes through the typed adapter harness selected by the active substrate file.
  The repo-local Pulsar topic spool remains only a harness-oriented path for endpoint-absent unit
  or isolated daemon checks, not a substitute for routed cluster validation
- integration coverage is driven by the comprehensive model, format, and engine matrix in
  `README.md`: one substrate-aware integration suite reads the active substrate from `.dhall`,
  chooses the corresponding engine binding for each supported row or reference, and runs at least
  one assertion for every such row
- Playwright E2E remains substrate-agnostic at the browser layer and relies on `infernix-demo` to
  read the same `.dhall` and dispatch the correct engine for the active substrate
- Harbor-first bootstrap, mandatory local HA platform services, Gateway-owned routing, operator-run
  Patroni PostgreSQL, manual `infernix-manual` storage, Haskell-owned frontend contracts, the
  shared Python adapter project, and untracked generated outputs all remain mandatory doctrine
- supported validation is substrate-specific: integration, E2E, and `test all` run their complete
  supported suites against the built and deployed substrate, and test reports name that substrate
  explicitly instead of implying matrix-wide coverage
- the supported control plane keeps one Haskell command registry,
  binary-owned lifecycle and validation orchestration, the current `ormolu` plus `hlint` plus
  `cabal format` style stack, and the existing files or docs or chart or proto validation
  entrypoints; shell bootstrap responsibility is limited to prerequisite and launcher setup
- every `infernix service` daemon remains startup-configured and Pulsar-driven without a separate
  admin-HTTP, hot-reload, or typed-event-ledger subsystem in the supported contract
- the test surface remains the current three Cabal stanzas plus the frontend unit suite:
  `infernix-unit`, `infernix-integration`, and `infernix-haskell-style`, exercised through the
  supported `infernix test lint|unit|integration|e2e|all` command surface

## Dependency Chain

| Phase | Depends on | Why |
|-------|------------|-----|
| 0 | none | establishes the governed docs suite and plan-maintenance rules the remaining phases rely on |
| 1 | 0 | closes the repository scaffold, the two-binary topology, the staged-substrate contract, and the governed root-document posture |
| 2 | 0-1 | builds Kind lifecycle, manual storage, Harbor-first image flow, and Linux launcher behavior on top of the repository foundations |
| 3 | 0-2 | adds the HA platform services, routed edge, and publication contract on top of the cluster lifecycle and storage baseline |
| 4 | 0-3 | closes the runtime, adapter boundary, object-store contract, and Apple host-daemon bridge on top of the HA platform surfaces |
| 5 | 0-4 | adds the clustered demo UI, generated frontend contracts, and routed browser validation on top of the runtime and publication contract |
| 6 | 0-5 | validates the whole supported surface end to end and hardens the governed docs, routes, and lifecycle behavior around that implementation |
| 7 | 0-6 | adds the multi-user durable-context demo application on top of the validated platform: Keycloak self-signup, WebSocket post-login transport, Pulsar-backed conversation log per context, MinIO-backed artifact upload/download/render-or-download, a Haskell-first logic boundary surfaced to PureScript via `purescript-bridge`, and the supported three-role daemon split (stateless `infernix-demo`, stateless `infernix-coordinator`, one-per-node `infernix-engine`) replacing today's fused `infernix-service` Deployment |
