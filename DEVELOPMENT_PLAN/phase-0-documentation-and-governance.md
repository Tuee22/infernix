# Phase 0: Documentation and Governance

**Status**: Active
**Referenced by**: [README.md](README.md), [00-overview.md](00-overview.md), [system-components.md](system-components.md)

> **Purpose**: Establish the governed `documents/` suite, the standards that keep the plan and
> docs aligned, and the documentation-first baseline that all later implementation phases depend on.

## Documentation-First Gate

Phase 0 closes the documentation bootstrap only. Later phases still own follow-on documentation
work whenever the implementation direction changes, but they do so on top of the governed suite and
lint rules established here.

## Current Repo Assessment

The governed `documents/` suite exists, `documents/documentation_standards.md` governs canonical
topic ownership, and the repo-local docs validator is part of the supported workflow. Later phases
extend that governed suite across the shared Linux substrate image, the shared Python adapter
project, the command registry, the route registry, testing doctrine, portability, implementation
boundaries, and the governed-root-document metadata model.

This plan update reopens Phase 0. The governed docs outside `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/` still describe the
earlier runtime-mode, simulated-substrate, Apple host-bridge, and Linux direct-GPU-launcher
doctrine. The plan now tracks a substrate-generated `.dhall` single-source-of-truth model, so the
governed docs and root workflow entrypoints must be realigned before later implementation phases
can close honestly against that new contract.

## Remaining Work

- close Sprint 0.8 so the governed docs, root docs, and plan all describe the same substrate
  selection, launcher, daemon-placement, and validation doctrine

## Sprint 0.1: `documents/` Suite Scaffold [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `documents/README.md`, `documents/architecture/overview.md`
**Docs to update**: `README.md`, `documents/README.md`

### Objective

Create the governed `documents/` suite and make it the canonical home for repository
documentation.

### Deliverables

- `documents/` exists as a governed docs root with architecture, development, engineering,
  operations, reference, tools, and research sections
- `documents/README.md` acts as the docs-suite index
- root `README.md` points readers into the governed docs suite rather than acting as the only doc home

### Validation

- the `documents/` tree exists in the repository
- `documents/README.md` indexes the governed docs sections

### Remaining Work

None.

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `documents/documentation_standards.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
**Docs to update**: `documents/documentation_standards.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`

### Objective

Define how governed docs, root workflow guidance, and later plan updates stay aligned.

### Deliverables

- `documents/documentation_standards.md` defines canonical topic ownership and summary-versus-source rules
- root automation guidance is explicitly governed instead of ad hoc
- the repo has a documentation-maintenance rule set that later phases can rely on

### Validation

- governed-doc standards exist in the worktree
- root workflow docs refer to the governed standards

### Remaining Work

None.

### Objective

Create the initial canonical document set for the supported platform contract.

### Deliverables

- core architecture, development, engineering, operations, reference, and tool docs exist
- the docs suite covers the supported CLI, runtime-mode contract, cluster lifecycle, storage
  doctrine, routing, model catalog, and demo UI surface
- later phases can update one canonical document per topic instead of inventing new topic homes

### Validation

- the listed governed docs exist
- the docs suite covers the supported architecture and workflow topics

### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 0.4: Documentation Validation and Plan Harmony [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Infernix/Lint/Docs.hs`, `README.md`
**Docs to update**: `documents/documentation_standards.md`, `documents/README.md`, `README.md`

### Objective

Make documentation drift mechanically visible and keep the plan aligned with the governed docs.

### Deliverables

- the repo-local docs validator exists
- documentation standards, the docs index, and the development plan are cross-linked
- documentation changes can be checked through a canonical repo-local validation path

### Validation

- the docs validator runs on the supported path
- governed docs and the plan cross-reference one another

### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 0.5: Runtime-Mode Matrix Documentation Realignment [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/00-overview.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system-components.md`, `documents/architecture/runtime_modes.md`, `documents/architecture/model_catalog.md`, `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/engineering/build_artifacts.md`
**Docs to update**: `README.md`, `documents/architecture/runtime_modes.md`, `documents/architecture/model_catalog.md`, `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/engineering/build_artifacts.md`, `documents/engineering/model_lifecycle.md`, `documents/tools/pulsar.md`, `documents/reference/web_portal_surface.md`

### Objective

Align the plan and docs around the runtime-mode matrix and generated catalog contract.

### Deliverables

- the plan distinguishes execution context from runtime mode
- the README matrix is treated as the source of truth for generated catalog selection
- the governed docs reference the active-mode generated demo-config and validation rules

### Validation

- the plan and governed docs use the same runtime-mode vocabulary
- the generated demo-config contract is described consistently across the listed docs

### Remaining Work

None.

### Objective

Bring the governed docs into alignment with the two-binary topology, Pulsar production surface,
demo-only HTTP surface, and generated-catalog architecture baseline.

### Deliverables

- the docs suite describes `infernix` and `infernix-demo` as the supported binary topology
- production inference is documented as Pulsar-only
- demo HTTP, browser workbench, and generated frontend contracts are documented as demo-only surfaces
- later implementation phases inherit a coherent docs baseline instead of mixed legacy language

### Validation

- the listed docs no longer describe the retired single-binary or Python-HTTP product shape
- documentation validation catches the retired-doctrine vocabulary tracked in the cleanup ledger

### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 0.7: Doctrine Realignment for Gateway API, Honest Runtime Model, and Hygiene [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `documents/engineering/edge_routing.md`, `documents/engineering/docker_policy.md`, `documents/engineering/build_artifacts.md`, `documents/development/python_policy.md`, `documents/development/purescript_policy.md`, `documents/operations/apple_silicon_runbook.md`, `documents/operations/cluster_bootstrap_runbook.md`, `documents/reference/cli_reference.md`, `documents/reference/web_portal_surface.md`, `documents/architecture/overview.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `src/Infernix/Lint/Docs.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/edge_routing.md`, `documents/engineering/docker_policy.md`, `documents/engineering/build_artifacts.md`, `documents/development/python_policy.md`, `documents/development/purescript_policy.md`, `documents/operations/apple_silicon_runbook.md`, `documents/operations/cluster_bootstrap_runbook.md`, `documents/reference/cli_reference.md`, `documents/reference/web_portal_surface.md`, `documents/architecture/overview.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`

### Objective

Realign the documentation suite around Envoy Gateway routing, the honest Apple-versus-Linux runtime
model, build-artifact hygiene, and the later DRY cleanup direction.

### Deliverables

- routing docs describe Gateway API ownership instead of repo-owned proxy processes
- build-artifact docs describe generated outputs as disposable and untracked
- operator docs distinguish Apple host-native execution from Linux outer-container execution
- later phases inherit explicit documentation obligations for the shared Linux substrate image, the
  shared Python adapter project, the command registry, and the route registry

### Validation

- the listed docs use the Gateway, Harbor-first, manual-storage, and generated-artifact vocabulary
- later phases can reference these docs without redefining the same governance baseline

### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 0.8: Substrate Doctrine Documentation Reset [Active]

**Status**: Active
**Implementation**: `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/00-overview.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system-components.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/development_plan_standards.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md`
**Docs to update**: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `documents/architecture/overview.md`, `documents/architecture/runtime_modes.md`, `documents/development/local_dev.md`, `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/engineering/build_artifacts.md`, `documents/engineering/docker_policy.md`, `documents/engineering/portability.md`, `documents/engineering/testing.md`, `documents/operations/apple_silicon_runbook.md`, `documents/operations/cluster_bootstrap_runbook.md`, `documents/reference/cli_reference.md`

### Objective

Realign the governed docs around the substrate-generated `.dhall` doctrine before the later
implementation follow-ons claim closure against it.

### Deliverables

- the governed docs describe substrates rather than user-selected runtime-mode flags as the final
  supported selection contract
- Apple operator docs describe host-native cluster control, host-native inference, and the
  cluster-resident demo app without the interim host bridge as a final doctrine
- Linux operator docs describe Compose as the single supported outer-container launcher for both
  `linux-cpu` and `linux-gpu`, with no supported Linux host-native build or CLI flow
- validation docs describe single-substrate integration and E2E ownership rather than default
  cross-substrate matrix coverage or simulated fallback evidence
- validation docs describe the comprehensive model, format, and engine matrix in `README.md` as the
  authoritative integration-test coverage ledger, with one `.dhall`-driven integration suite that
  chooses the active engine per supported row or reference
- validation docs describe Playwright as substrate-agnostic at the browser layer and make
  `infernix-demo` responsible for reading the active `.dhall` and dispatching the correct engine
- governed docs describe simulation as removed from the supported runtime and validation contract,
  not merely unsupported evidence
- root guidance names the compile-time generated substrate `.dhall` as the single source of truth
  for active substrate, generated catalog, daemon placement, and validation scope

### Validation

- `infernix lint docs` passes after the governed docs and root docs are updated
- `infernix docs check` fails if the governed docs or root docs keep stale runtime-mode or
  simulation doctrine once this sprint lands
- `infernix docs check` fails if the governed docs still describe browser-side substrate selection,
  separate per-substrate integration suites, or any simulated fallback as part of the supported
  contract

### Remaining Work

- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` still reflect the earlier launcher and validation story
- the governed docs listed above still need substrate-language, launcher, and validation updates

## Documentation Requirements

**Engineering docs to create/update:**
- `documents/documentation_standards.md` - canonical ownership and summary-versus-source rules
- `documents/README.md` - docs-suite index and entry points

- `CLAUDE.md` - governed automation entry document

**Cross-references to add:**
- keep [DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md](README.md), [00-overview.md](00-overview.md), and
  [system-components.md](system-components.md) aligned when documentation governance or
  architecture-baseline language changes
