# Phase 6: Validation, E2E, and HA Hardening

**Status**: Done
**Referenced by**: [README.md](README.md), [00-overview.md](00-overview.md), [system-components.md](system-components.md)

> **Purpose**: Define the supported static-quality and single-substrate validation contract for the
> two-binary topology, the README-matrix-driven integration suite, the Pulsar-driven production
> inference surface, the demo UI host, the substrate-generated catalog, the mandatory HA behavior
> of Harbor, MinIO, operator-managed PostgreSQL, and Pulsar, and the remaining
> repository-hardening follow-ons that keep governed root docs, route-aware docs, and the CLI
> surface mechanically aligned with implementation.

## Phase Status

Phase 6 is complete. The validation entrypoints, routed coverage, governed-root-document metadata
closure, structured CLI-registry closure, and the earlier compatibility-shim cleanup are present
in the current worktree, the supported test story is substrate-specific, and the full supported
validation rerun passed.

## Current Repo Assessment

The repository has lint, unit, integration, and Playwright entrypoints. The canonical testing,
boundary, portability, storage, and Haskell-style docs are present, the baked Linux substrate
image carries the source-snapshot manifest needed for git-less `infernix lint files` runs, the
routed Playwright suite exhaustively exercises every demo-visible generated catalog entry for the
active substrate, and the integration suite enumerates every generated active-substrate catalog
entry while also carrying Harbor, MinIO, Pulsar, and Harbor PostgreSQL recovery or lifecycle
checks in code. The staged file, `cluster status`, publication JSON, and generated browser
contracts still expose the active substrate through `runtimeMode` fields or lines. The supported
full validation rerun passed, so this phase is done.

## Validation Surface

The supported validation entrypoints are:

- `infernix lint files`
- `infernix lint docs`
- `infernix lint proto`
- `infernix lint chart`
- `infernix docs check`
- `infernix test lint`
- `infernix test unit`
- `infernix test integration`
- `infernix test e2e`
- `infernix test all`

These commands are declarative and idempotent validation entrypoints. Re-running them rechecks the
same contract and may reconcile supported prerequisites instead of depending on alternate setup
commands.

## Current Validation Baseline

- `test unit` proves matrix typing, generated catalog rendering, and contract-generation logic
- `test integration` validates the active substrate's published catalog contract, routed surfaces,
  and routed inference execution for every generated active-substrate catalog entry
- `test e2e` exercises every demo-visible generated catalog entry for the active substrate
- `test all` reports only the active built substrate instead of implying cross-substrate coverage

## Sprint 6.1: Static Quality Gates, Testing Doctrine, and Unit Suites [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Infernix/CLI.hs`, `src/Infernix/Lint/`, `src/Infernix/Lint/HaskellStyle.hs`, `src/Infernix/Lint/Files.hs`, `test/haskell-style/Spec.hs`, `test/unit/Spec.hs`, `web/test/Main.purs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/development/haskell_style.md`, `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/engineering/testing.md`, `documents/engineering/implementation_boundaries.md`, `documents/engineering/portability.md`, `documents/engineering/storage_and_state.md`

### Objective

Make static-quality enforcement and unit coverage broad enough to protect the control plane, shared
contracts, and generated-catalog logic, and put the validation doctrine in canonical docs.

### Deliverables

- `infernix test lint` is the canonical static-quality entrypoint
- the repo-owned lint layer enforces whitespace, newline, tab, docs, chart, proto, and tracked-file policy
- the Haskell style guide clearly separates:
  - hard gates enforced mechanically
  - review guidance that remains human doctrine
  - the enforcement model implemented in `src/Infernix/Lint/HaskellStyle.hs`
- the Haskell style guide states the fail-fast rule explicitly: validation fails on hard-gate
  violations and does not silently rewrite tracked source
- `documents/engineering/testing.md` becomes the canonical testing doctrine
- `documents/engineering/implementation_boundaries.md`, `documents/engineering/portability.md`,
  and `documents/engineering/storage_and_state.md` are expanded so boundary, portability, and
  durability rules are canonical and testable
- `infernix test unit` remains the canonical unit-suite entrypoint for Haskell and PureScript

### Validation

- `infernix test lint` passes when repo-owned lint, docs, and compiler-warning policy are satisfied
- Haskell formatting or lint drift fails `cabal --builddir=.build/cabal test infernix-haskell-style`
- `infernix test unit` runs both Haskell and frontend unit suites
- docs validation fails if canonical testing or boundary docs drift from the supported implementation

### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 6.2: Extensive Integration Suites [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Infernix/Cluster.hs`, `src/Infernix/Demo/Api.hs`, `src/Infernix/Runtime.hs`, `test/integration/Spec.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/operations/cluster_bootstrap_runbook.md`

### Objective

Exercise the generated demo-config and service integration path on the final Kind, Helm, Harbor,
MinIO, Pulsar, and operator-managed PostgreSQL substrate.

### Deliverables

- integration coverage for `cluster up`, generated demo-config publication, and routed inference
  execution for every generated active-substrate catalog entry
- host-native integration coverage proves the routed API can keep one browser-visible entrypoint
  while Apple inference remains host-native
- dedicated `linux-gpu` integration coverage proves device-plugin rollout, GPU resources, and
  service GPU visibility
- integration coverage proves routed cache mutation and publication surfaces stay aligned with the
  generated catalog contract

### Validation

- `infernix test integration` reconciles or reuses supported cluster prerequisites
- integration tests fail when publication state, generated catalog publication, per-entry routed
  inference execution, service-loop schema publication, or CUDA scheduling assertions regress

### Remaining Work

None.

---

## Sprint 6.3: Routed Playwright E2E Coverage [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Infernix/CLI.hs`, `web/playwright/inference.spec.js`, `web/test/run_playwright_matrix.mjs`, `web/package.json`
**Docs to update**: `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/reference/web_portal_surface.md`

### Objective

Keep routed Playwright validation on the supported final execution paths while exercising the real
browser surface through the shared edge.

### Deliverables

- Playwright suites live under the UI-owned `web/playwright/` surface
- `infernix test e2e` exercises the routed browser surface launched from the substrate image on
  Linux or from a container-owned executor orchestrated by the host CLI on Apple Silicon
- supported Playwright invocations use `npm --prefix web exec -- playwright ...`
- E2E covers publication details, model selection, manual inference submission, and result rendering

### Validation

- `infernix test e2e` hits the routed path rather than bypassing the edge
- the routed Playwright suite fails if any active-substrate catalog entry is skipped
- Apple host E2E and Linux substrate-image E2E both pass on their supported lanes

### Remaining Work

None.

---

## Sprint 6.4: HA Failure and Recovery Coverage For Harbor, MinIO, and Pulsar [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `test/integration/Spec.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/development/chaos_testing.md`, `documents/tools/harbor.md`, `documents/tools/minio.md`, `documents/tools/pulsar.md`

### Objective

Back the HA claims with concrete failure coverage.

### Deliverables

- pod-deletion and rolling-restart coverage for Harbor application-plane workloads
- durability and failover coverage for MinIO on the mandatory HA topology
- message continuity and restart coverage for Pulsar on the mandatory HA topology

### Validation

- supported HA subsets prove single-pod failure does not permanently break the supported path
- data written before MinIO or Pulsar restarts remains available afterward
- Harbor-backed image pulls continue to work after supported Harbor pod replacement

### Remaining Work

None.

---

## Sprint 6.5: Cluster Lifecycle and Environment-Matrix Validation [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Infernix/Cluster.hs`, `src/Infernix/Config.hs`, `src/Infernix/CLI.hs`, `compose.yaml`, `kind/cluster-apple-silicon.yaml`, `kind/cluster-linux-cpu.yaml`, `kind/cluster-linux-gpu.yaml`, `test/integration/Spec.hs`, `web/playwright/inference.spec.js`, `web/test/run_playwright_matrix.mjs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/operations/apple_silicon_runbook.md`

### Objective

Verify the same product contract across Apple host-native and Linux outer-container workflows.

### Deliverables

- the codebase exposes `cluster up`, `cluster status`, and `cluster down` through both execution contexts
- automated coverage proves repo-local kubeconfig, generated demo-config, publication mirror, and
  publication state creation for the active built substrate
- `cluster status` reports the active substrate through its current `runtimeMode` line together
  with build or data roots, publication details, and the chosen edge port

### Validation

- `infernix test integration` proves the host-native lane creates the expected repo-local state
- validation proves the Linux outer-container lane can reach the cluster through its supported path
- repeated `cluster up` or `cluster down` behavior and `9090`-first edge-port rediscovery remain stable

### Remaining Work

None.

---

## Sprint 6.6: Generated-Catalog Exhaustive Integration and E2E Coverage Baseline [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Infernix/CLI.hs`, `src/Infernix/Lint/Files.hs`, `test/unit/Spec.hs`, `test/integration/Spec.hs`, `web/playwright/inference.spec.js`, `web/test/Main.purs`, `web/test/run_playwright_matrix.mjs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/reference/web_portal_surface.md`, `documents/reference/cli_reference.md`, `documents/engineering/testing.md`

### Objective

Make the README promise concrete for the generated-catalog coverage machinery so the later
single-substrate validation closure rests on explicit per-substrate catalog enumeration rather than
hard-coded lane lists.

### Deliverables

- `infernix test integration` enumerates every generated catalog entry from the active
  build-generated demo config
- `infernix test e2e` is specified to exercise every demo-visible generated catalog entry through
  the routed browser surface
- `infernix test all` aggregates lint, unit, integration, and E2E without silently dropping catalog entries
- the coverage machinery derives its exercised catalog from the generated substrate file instead of
  hard-coded per-lane model lists

### Validation

- changing the built substrate changes the exercised catalog and engine assertions automatically
- integration fails if any generated catalog entry is skipped
- routed E2E fails if any demo-visible generated catalog entry is skipped once Sprint 6.3 closes

### Remaining Work

None.

---

## Sprint 6.19: Single-Substrate Validation Closure and Simulation Removal [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Infernix/Config.hs`, `src/Infernix/CLI.hs`, `web/test/run_playwright_matrix.mjs`, `docker/linux-substrate.Dockerfile`, `test/integration/Spec.hs`, `test/unit/Spec.hs`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/00-overview.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system-components.md`
**Docs to update**: `README.md`, `documents/development/local_dev.md`, `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/development/chaos_testing.md`, `documents/engineering/testing.md`, `documents/engineering/portability.md`, `documents/reference/cli_reference.md`, `documents/operations/apple_silicon_runbook.md`, `documents/operations/cluster_bootstrap_runbook.md`

### Objective

Make every supported test command exercise only the built and deployed substrate, remove
simulation from the supported runtime and validation contract completely, and describe integration
and E2E ownership in the final `.dhall`-driven terms.

### Deliverables

- `infernix test integration`, `infernix test e2e`, and `infernix test all` exercise only the
  substrate encoded in the generated `.dhall`
- the supported default test story no longer runs a cross-substrate Apple or CPU or GPU matrix from
  one invocation
- the comprehensive model, format, and engine matrix in `README.md` is the authoritative
  integration-test coverage ledger
- one integration suite traverses those README rows or references, reads the active substrate from
  `.dhall`, chooses the corresponding engine binding for each supported row, and carries at least
  one assertion for every such row
- the repository does not maintain separate integration suites per substrate; substrate choice
  happens only through the generated `.dhall`
- Apple host-native `test integration` is launched directly from the host CLI and manages the host
  inference daemon for the duration of the test when that daemon is needed
- Apple host-native `test e2e` is launched from the host CLI while the actual Playwright executor
  runs through a direct `docker run` of the Playwright-capable Linux substrate image
- Linux substrate test commands all run through `docker compose run --rm infernix infernix ...`,
  and those flows do not manage a host daemon because inference runs from the cluster daemon
- Playwright remains substrate-agnostic at the browser layer: the browser suite does not branch on
  substrate id or engine family, and it relies on `infernix-demo` to read `.dhall` and dispatch
  the correct engine behind the routed demo API
- test results report the built substrate unambiguously and never imply matrix-wide coverage they
  did not execute
- supported runtime and validation code carry no simulated cluster, route, transport, or inference
  fallback behavior on the supported path

### Validation

- Apple host-native `test all` reports `apple-silicon` only, starts the host daemon as needed, and
  delegates Playwright execution to that direct containerized image path without changing the
  reported substrate
- Linux `test all` reports only the built Linux substrate and runs entirely through the outer
  container launcher
- for any given built substrate, integration validation fails if a README row or reference whose
  substrate column names a real engine is not covered by at least one integration assertion using
  the engine selected from `.dhall`
- E2E validation fails if browser-side test code branches on substrate id or engine family instead
  of relying on the demo app's `.dhall`-driven dispatch
- docs and test output fail if validation still claims Apple, CPU, and GPU coverage from one
  default matrix invocation or keeps simulation in the supported contract

### Remaining Work

None.

---

## Sprint 6.7: Operator-Managed PostgreSQL Failure and Lifecycle Coverage [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Infernix/Cluster.hs`, `test/integration/Spec.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/development/chaos_testing.md`, `documents/operations/cluster_bootstrap_runbook.md`, `documents/tools/postgresql.md`

### Objective

Back the PostgreSQL doctrine with readiness, failover, and storage-rebind coverage.

### Deliverables

- integration coverage proves Percona and Patroni readiness for Harbor and later PostgreSQL-backed services
- HA-failure coverage deletes or restarts a PostgreSQL member and verifies failover
- lifecycle coverage proves `cluster down` plus `cluster up` reuses the same deterministic Harbor
  PostgreSQL PV inventory and host paths
- validation proves services do not regress to chart-managed standalone PostgreSQL deployments

### Validation

- `infernix test integration` verifies ready operator-managed PostgreSQL members, Patroni failover,
  and deterministic Harbor PV and host-path rebinding
- repeated cluster lifecycle validation fails if Harbor PostgreSQL no longer reuses the same
  deterministic PV inventory and host paths

### Remaining Work

None.

---

## Sprint 6.8: Minimal Host Prerequisites and Clean-Host Bootstrap Closure [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `src/Infernix/HostPrereqs.hs`, `src/Infernix/Engines/AppleSilicon.hs`, `src/Infernix/Python.hs`, `src/Infernix/Cluster.hs`, `src/Infernix/CLI.hs`, `documents/development/local_dev.md`, `documents/operations/apple_silicon_runbook.md`, `documents/development/python_policy.md`, `documents/engineering/portability.md`, `documents/engineering/docker_policy.md`
**Docs to update**: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `documents/development/local_dev.md`, `documents/operations/apple_silicon_runbook.md`, `documents/development/python_policy.md`, `documents/engineering/portability.md`, `documents/engineering/docker_policy.md`, `documents/operations/cluster_bootstrap_runbook.md`

### Objective

Minimize host-side prerequisites and let `infernix` reconcile the remaining supported operator
toolchain from package managers instead of depending on a broad preinstalled Apple host stack.

### Deliverables

- Apple host-native flow reduces pre-existing host requirements to Homebrew plus ghcup before
  building `./.build/infernix`
- Colima is the only supported Docker environment on Apple Silicon, and the supported Apple path
  installs or starts Colima through Homebrew-managed tooling
- after the Apple binary exists, `infernix` can reconcile the remaining supported Homebrew-managed
  operator tools needed by the active path, including the Docker CLI, `kind`, `kubectl`, `helm`,
  and Node.js
- when Apple adapter flows first need Poetry and the `poetry` executable is absent, `infernix`
  can bootstrap Poetry through the host's built-in Python and then continue all host-side Python
  management through the shared Poetry project
- `linux-cpu` host prerequisites stop at Docker Engine plus the Docker Compose plugin
- `linux-gpu` host prerequisites stop at Docker Engine plus the supported NVIDIA driver and
  container-toolkit setup
- clean-host validation proves the supported commands reconcile prerequisites rather than relying on
  undocumented manual setup beyond those minimal host baselines

### Validation

- on a clean Apple Silicon host with only Homebrew plus ghcup present,
  `cabal --builddir=.build/cabal install --installdir=./.build --install-method=copy --overwrite-policy=always exe:infernix exe:infernix-demo`
  succeeds, and `./.build/infernix cluster up` reconciles the
  remaining supported Apple host prerequisites through the supported package-manager path
- Apple host validation proves the supported flow can bootstrap Poetry when absent and then run the
  adapter setup path without manual Poetry installation
- on a clean Linux CPU host with Docker only,
  `docker compose build infernix` plus `docker compose run --rm infernix infernix test all`
  passes
- on a clean Linux GPU host with Docker plus the supported NVIDIA host prerequisites,
  exporting `INFERNIX_COMPOSE_IMAGE=infernix-linux-gpu:local`,
  `INFERNIX_COMPOSE_SUBSTRATE=linux-gpu`, and
  `INFERNIX_COMPOSE_BASE_IMAGE=nvidia/cuda:13.2.1-cudnn-runtime-ubuntu24.04`, then running
  `docker compose build infernix` plus `docker compose run --rm infernix infernix test all`,
  passes

### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 6.9: Governed Root-Document Metadata Closure [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `documents/documentation_standards.md`, `src/Infernix/Lint/Docs.hs`
**Docs to update**: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `documents/documentation_standards.md`, `documents/README.md`

### Objective

Close the stricter governed-root-document metadata model so the root entry documents match the
standards they already cite.

### Deliverables

- `README.md` carries the governed root-document metadata block appropriate for an orientation
  document and makes its canonical-home links explicit
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` carry the explicit supersession or canonical-home markers required
  for governed entry documents and stay thin while linking to the canonical assistant-workflow
  document under `documents/`
- `documents/documentation_standards.md` describes the root-document metadata contract in the same
  terms the repo actually enforces
- the docs linter grows root-document checks strong enough to catch missing root-document metadata
  markers rather than relying on convention alone

### Validation

- `infernix docs check` fails when `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` are missing the
  required governed metadata markers for their declared role
- root docs carry the governed metadata and canonical-home links needed for the canonical
  assistant-workflow entrypoint without losing the canonical topic entrypoints

### Remaining Work

None.

---

## Sprint 6.10: True Single-Definition CLI Registry Closure [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Infernix/CommandRegistry.hs`, `src/Infernix/CLI.hs`, `src/Infernix/Lint/Docs.hs`, `documents/reference/cli_reference.md`, `documents/reference/cli_surface.md`, `test/unit/Spec.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/reference/cli_reference.md`, `documents/reference/cli_surface.md`, `documents/development/local_dev.md`, `README.md`

### Objective

Collapse the supported CLI surface into one structured Haskell definition so parsing, help text,
and the canonical CLI reference stop drifting independently.

### Deliverables

- one structured Haskell registry owns supported command parsing, help text, and command-family
  metadata
- the canonical CLI reference derives from that same structured registry or from a mechanically
  equivalent generated artifact rather than a separate handwritten command inventory
- `documents/reference/cli_surface.md` remains a short family overview that summarizes and links to
  the canonical CLI reference
- docs lint validates the stronger CLI-registry contract instead of only checking that registry
  command lines appear somewhere in the reference document

### Validation

- `./.build/infernix --help` and the canonical CLI reference enumerate the same supported command
  families from the same structured registry source
- changing a supported command in the structured registry changes parsing, help output, and CLI
  reference material through one implementation path
- `infernix docs check` fails when the CLI reference drifts from the structured command registry

### Remaining Work

None.

---

## Sprint 6.11: Registry-Backed Route Docs and Lint Closure [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Infernix/Routes.hs`, `src/Infernix/Lint/Chart.hs`, `src/Infernix/Lint/Docs.hs`, `documents/engineering/edge_routing.md`, `documents/reference/web_portal_surface.md`, `documents/tools/harbor.md`, `documents/tools/minio.md`, `documents/tools/pulsar.md`, `documents/operations/cluster_bootstrap_runbook.md`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md`
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/edge_routing.md`, `documents/reference/web_portal_surface.md`, `documents/tools/harbor.md`, `documents/tools/minio.md`, `documents/tools/pulsar.md`, `documents/operations/cluster_bootstrap_runbook.md`, `README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md`

### Objective

Finish the remaining route or publication DRY cleanup so the Haskell route registry drives
route-aware docs and validation, not only runtime rendering and Helm values.

### Deliverables

- the Haskell route registry remains the source of truth for rendered HTTPRoutes, publication
  state, and route-aware documentation summaries
- route-oriented docs consume registry-backed rendered content or a mechanically equivalent
  generated section instead of independent handwritten route inventories
- docs lint and chart lint validate the route-aware contract from registry-backed expectations
  rather than ad hoc phrase checks
- the cleanup ledger records no remaining handwritten route-inventory or route-aware lint
  duplication once the sprint closes

### Validation

- `GET /api/publication` still reports the exact route inventory produced by the registry
- `infernix docs check` fails when a registry-owned route summary drifts from the corresponding docs
  section
- `infernix test lint` fails when route-aware lint or chart expectations diverge from the
  registry-backed route contract
- routed Harbor, MinIO, Pulsar, and demo probes continue to pass on the shared edge

### Remaining Work

None.

---

## Sprint 6.12: Assistant Workflow Canonicalization and Workflow-Helper Deduplication [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `documents/development/assistant_workflow.md`, `documents/documentation_standards.md`, `documents/README.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `documents/development/local_dev.md`, `src/Infernix/Workflow.hs`, `src/Infernix/Cluster.hs`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md`
**Docs to update**: `documents/development/assistant_workflow.md`, `documents/documentation_standards.md`, `documents/README.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `documents/development/local_dev.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md`

### Objective

Finish the remaining REPO_DRY_CLEANUP follow-ons for assistant-facing root guidance and shared
workflow-helper closure.

### Deliverables

- repo-level assistant workflow doctrine moves into one canonical governed document under
  `documents/`
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` become thin governed entry docs that summarize and link to that
  canonical assistant-workflow doc instead of carrying long parallel rule sets
- `src/Infernix/Workflow.hs` owns shared web-dependency readiness, npm invocation resolution,
  platform-command availability checks, and shared generated-file banner constants; cluster and CLI
  paths reuse it instead of re-declaring their own readiness probes
- the cleanup ledger no longer tracks duplicated assistant guidance or duplicated web-dependency
  readiness logic once the sprint closes

### Validation

- `infernix docs check` fails if the canonical assistant-workflow doc or the root-doc links drift
- `rg -n "webBuildToolchainPresent|ensureWebBuildDependencies" src/Infernix` shows one supported
  readiness implementation path rather than parallel cluster-local copies
- supported CLI, docs, and outer-container flows still install web dependencies through the shared
  helper

### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 6.13: Engineering Doctrine Depth and Haskell Guide Completion [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `documents/engineering/implementation_boundaries.md`, `documents/engineering/storage_and_state.md`, `documents/engineering/portability.md`, `documents/engineering/testing.md`, `documents/development/haskell_style.md`, `src/Infernix/Lint/Docs.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/implementation_boundaries.md`, `documents/engineering/storage_and_state.md`, `documents/engineering/portability.md`, `documents/engineering/testing.md`, `documents/development/haskell_style.md`, `documents/documentation_standards.md`

### Objective

Finish the remaining `mattandjames`-inspired doctrine-depth work so the broad engineering docs and
the Haskell guide match the stronger structure already required by
`development_plan_standards.md`.
That import is explicitly about repository governance and doctrine shape, not about adopting
`mattandjames` product-specific features or runtime assumptions.

### Deliverables

- broad governed engineering docs that define supported contracts add the stronger structure from
  `development_plan_standards.md`: `TL;DR` or `Executive Summary` when the topic is broad,
  explicit `Current Status` notes when current behavior and target direction mix, and explicit
  `Validation` sections when tests or lint prove the contract
- `documents/engineering/implementation_boundaries.md` gains an ownership matrix for Haskell,
  Python, chart, and generated surfaces together with adapter-local-versus-shared-contract type
  boundaries, instance placement rules, and module-boundary doctrine
- `documents/engineering/storage_and_state.md` gains an owner or durability table plus
  failure-mode, rebuild, and cleanup rules for durable and derived state
- `documents/engineering/portability.md` explicitly separates portable platform invariants from
  local harness detail and names which differences are supported product contract versus substrate
  implementation detail
- `documents/engineering/testing.md` keeps the canonical testing doctrine in the stronger
  structure and explicitly calls out preflight expectations, unsupported paths, and per-layer
  validation obligations
- `documents/development/haskell_style.md` points directly at `src/Infernix/Lint/HaskellStyle.hs`,
  separates repository hard-gate inputs from editor-only guidance, and adds review doctrine for
  module shape, function shape, effect-boundary clarity, and typed control flow
- the plan states explicitly that this `mattandjames`-derived follow-on imports repository
  governance, CLI, launcher-boundary, and doctrine-structure practices only; it does not adopt
  offline-browser or Keycloak flows, a single-runtime `llama-server` model, IndexedDB-specific
  docs, checked-in generated PureScript policy, or a container-only execution rule
- `src/Infernix/Lint/Docs.hs` enforces the required broad-doctrine sections for the docs whose
  structure is part of the supported contract

### Validation

- `infernix docs check` fails when the named doctrine docs lose their required
  summary-or-current-status-or-validation structure or contradict their enforced metadata contract
- `infernix test lint` still passes once the deeper doc structure and Haskell-guide references land
- `cabal --builddir=.build/cabal test infernix-haskell-style` remains the implementation-aligned
  Haskell style gate described by the guide

### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 6.14: Monitoring Stance Resolution and Final Doctrine Closure [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `documents/README.md`, `documents/engineering/testing.md`, `chart/values.yaml`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/00-overview.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system-components.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md`, `src/Infernix/Cluster.hs`, `src/Infernix/Lint/Docs.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/README.md`, `documents/engineering/testing.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/00-overview.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system-components.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md`

### Objective

Resolve the supported monitoring stance explicitly and remove the dormant monitoring placeholder
from the supported contract.

### Deliverables

- the repository carries one explicit supported-contract decision for monitoring instead of a
  dangling placeholder
- Monitoring is not a supported first-class surface.
- governed docs and the plan say so explicitly, the dormant `victoria-metrics-k8s-stack` chart
  value is removed, and the cleanup is recorded in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md`
- the docs index and system component inventory point at the chosen monitoring stance so readers do
  not infer support from leftover config alone
- `src/Infernix/Lint/Docs.hs` checks that the governed docs, plan docs, and chart values stay
  aligned on the unsupported monitoring stance

### Validation

- `infernix docs check` fails if the plan, docs index, and unsupported-surface statement diverge
- `infernix docs check` fails if dormant monitoring configuration returns to `chart/values.yaml`
- the cleanup ledger records the retired monitoring-stack placeholder

### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 6.15: Validation Warning Hygiene For PureScript And Playwright [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `web/test/Main.purs`, `web/test/run_playwright_matrix.mjs`, `src/Infernix/CLI.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/engineering/testing.md`, `documents/development/purescript_policy.md`

### Objective

Remove the known non-failing warning noise from the supported web-validation path so `test unit`,
`test e2e`, and `test all` stay future-proof and produce clean supported output.

### Deliverables

- the PureScript unit suite no longer relies on deprecated `runSpec`
- the supported Node-based PureScript test runner preserves non-zero exits without relying on the
  deprecated `runSpec` or `runSpecT` entrypoints
- the Playwright matrix launcher sanitizes its child-process environment so supported runs do not
  pass both `NO_COLOR` and `FORCE_COLOR`
- the Apple host-native Playwright launch path applies the same color-env sanitization
- the governed testing docs describe the supported runner and env-sanitization posture for the web
  test path

### Validation

- `infernix test unit` passes without the PureScript `runSpec` deprecation warning
- `infernix test e2e` passes without the Node warning about `NO_COLOR` being ignored because
  `FORCE_COLOR` is set
- `infernix test all` continues to pass after the warning cleanup lands

### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 6.16: Residual Canonical-Home and Workflow-Helper Closure [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `README.md`, `documents/engineering/testing.md`, `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/README.md`, `src/Infernix/Workflow.hs`, `src/Infernix/DemoConfig.hs`, `src/Infernix/Lint/Docs.hs`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md`
**Docs to update**: `README.md`, `documents/engineering/testing.md`, `documents/development/testing_strategy.md`, `documents/README.md`, `documents/architecture/runtime_modes.md`, `documents/documentation_standards.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/00-overview.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system-components.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md`

### Objective

Close the last residual DRY and canonical-topic gaps surfaced by the repo review so the runtime
model, testing doctrine, and shared workflow-helper contract stop overclaiming closure.

### Deliverables

- the root README uses the same honest runtime-language contract as the governed docs and plan:
  one host-native Apple inference lane plus two containerized Linux lanes
- `documents/engineering/testing.md` remains the sole canonical testing doctrine, and
  `documents/development/testing_strategy.md` is reduced to supporting operator-detail guidance
  instead of a second authoritative canonical validation surface
- `src/Infernix/Workflow.hs` owns the demo-config generated-banner constant and
  `src/Infernix/DemoConfig.hs` consumes that shared literal instead of keeping a parallel copy
- docs lint and the cleanup ledger both record the closure so those stale guidance or duplicate
  helper surfaces do not quietly return

### Validation

- `infernix docs check` fails if the governed testing-doc metadata or purpose text reintroduce a
  second canonical testing home or if the root runtime-language contract drifts from the governed
  honest-runtime model
- `infernix test unit` continues to pass once demo-config generation and decoding consume one
  shared banner literal
- `infernix test lint` continues to pass after the ledger and docs-lint rules are updated for the
  final canonical-home cleanup

### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 6.17: Residual Compatibility-Shim Removal [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/Infernix/Runtime.hs`, `src/Infernix/Runtime/Cache.hs`, `src/Infernix/CLI.hs`, `src/Infernix/Cluster.hs`, `test/unit/Spec.hs`, `test/integration/Spec.hs`
**Docs to update**: `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/00-overview.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system-components.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/legacy-tracking-for-deletion.md`, `documents/development/frontend_contracts.md`, `documents/engineering/build_artifacts.md`, `documents/engineering/storage_and_state.md`, `documents/operations/cluster_bootstrap_runbook.md`

### Objective

Retire the last compatibility shims that keep obsolete result, generated-contract, and helper-registry
state alive in supported code paths so Phase 6 can close without hidden cleanup work.

### Deliverables

- `src/Infernix/Runtime.hs` and `src/Infernix/Runtime/Cache.hs` read only the supported
  protobuf-backed inference-result and cache-manifest files and stop accepting retired
  `*.state` fallbacks
- `src/Infernix/CLI.hs` stops deleting the retired `web/src/Infernix/Web/Contracts.purs` path
  during contract generation, leaving `web/src/Generated/Contracts.purs` as the only supported
  generated frontend-contract output
- `src/Infernix/Cluster.hs` stops removing the retired `infernix-bootstrap-registry` container and
  `./.build/kind/registry/localhost:30001` namespace as part of supported Harbor-first bootstrap
- unit, integration, and docs validation cover the shim-free behavior, and the cleanup ledger
  records those surfaces as fully closed once the implementation lands

### Validation

- `infernix test unit` fails if runtime result IO, cache-manifest reloads, or PureScript
  contract generation still depends on the retired `*.state`, `default.state`, or
  `web/src/Infernix/Web/Contracts.purs` compatibility paths
- `infernix test integration` fails if the supported cluster bootstrap flow still depends on the
  retired helper-registry cleanup shims
- `infernix docs check` fails if the plan, cleanup ledger, or supporting docs overclaim full
  closure before those compatibility surfaces are removed

### Remaining Work

None.

## Sprint 6.18: Remaining Broad Engineering-Doc Structure Closure [Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `documents/engineering/build_artifacts.md`, `documents/engineering/docker_policy.md`, `documents/engineering/edge_routing.md`, `src/Infernix/Lint/Docs.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/build_artifacts.md`, `documents/engineering/docker_policy.md`, `documents/engineering/edge_routing.md`, `documents/documentation_standards.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/00-overview.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/system-components.md`

### Objective

Close the remaining doctrine-depth gap for broad engineering contract docs so the plan stops
overclaiming full structure closure and `infernix docs check` enforces the same stronger shape
consistently across the remaining governed engineering surfaces.

### Deliverables

- `documents/engineering/build_artifacts.md` adds the stronger broad-doctrine structure expected
  by `development_plan_standards.md`, including summary and validation sections and any explicit
  current-status note required by its final scope
- `documents/engineering/docker_policy.md` adds the stronger broad-doctrine structure expected by
  `development_plan_standards.md`, including summary and validation sections and any explicit
  current-status note required by its final scope
- `documents/engineering/edge_routing.md` adds the stronger broad-doctrine structure expected by
  `development_plan_standards.md`, including summary and validation sections and any explicit
  current-status note required by its final scope
- `src/Infernix/Lint/Docs.hs` extends its document-structure rules so `infernix docs check`
  enforces the required broad-doctrine sections for those remaining engineering docs
- the plan and governed docs stop claiming that the broader engineering-doc structure is fully
  closed before those remaining docs and lint rules land

### Validation

- `infernix docs check` fails if `documents/engineering/build_artifacts.md`,
  `documents/engineering/docker_policy.md`, or `documents/engineering/edge_routing.md` lose the
  required broad-doctrine sections once Sprint 6.18 lands
- `infernix docs check` fails if the plan or governed docs overclaim full doctrine-depth closure
  before the remaining structure and lint enforcement land
- `infernix test lint` continues to pass once the broadened docs-lint structure rules are in place

### Remaining Work

None.
