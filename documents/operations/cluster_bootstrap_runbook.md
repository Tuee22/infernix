# Cluster Bootstrap Runbook

> **Purpose**: Describe the supported cluster lifecycle and durable-state expectations.

## Bring-Up

- confirm the active build root already carries `infernix-substrate.dhall`; on Apple host-native
  flows stage it with `./.build/infernix internal materialize-substrate apple-silicon`, and the
  supported Linux image build stages it while baking the substrate image
- run `infernix cluster up`
- on the Apple host-native path, the command reconciles Homebrew-managed Colima, Docker CLI,
  `kind`, `kubectl`, and `helm` before it attempts the real Kind workflow
- for `linux-gpu`, confirm the supported NVIDIA host satisfies the documented `nvidia-smi` and
  `docker run --gpus all` preflight contract before cluster creation
- for `linux-gpu`, also confirm the host filesystem has substantial free space before `cluster up`
  or `test all`; low disk headroom can make Kind-hosted BookKeeper ledger directories
  non-writable during the Harbor-backed rollout and prevent `infernix-service` readiness
- confirm that the chosen edge port, active runtime mode, generated demo-config paths, and
  build-root publication details are printed
- on the real Kind path, confirm that Harbor is the first deployed service on a pristine cluster
  and that only Harbor-required backend services pull from public container repositories before
  Harbor is ready
- the supported Harbor-first bootstrap path no longer depends on the retired
  `infernix-bootstrap-registry` container or the old `./.build/kind/registry/localhost:30001`
  helper-registry namespace
- on the supported outer-container path, confirm that `cluster up` reuses the already-built
  `infernix-linux-<mode>:local` snapshot instead of rebuilding that runtime image inside the
  launcher
- confirm that `cluster up` preloads Harbor-backed final image refs onto the Kind worker before the
  remaining non-Harbor workloads begin their final rollout
- confirm that `infernix kubectl get pods -n platform` shows the Envoy Gateway data plane,
  `infernix-service`, the Harbor application-plane workloads, the MinIO statefulset, the Pulsar
  statefulsets, and the PostgreSQL operator-managed members
- confirm that `infernix kubectl get gatewayclass infernix-gateway` reports `Accepted=True`,
  `infernix kubectl -n platform get gateway infernix-edge` reports `Accepted=True` and
  `Programmed=True`, and `infernix kubectl -n platform get envoyproxy infernix-edge` is present
- when the active `.dhall` enables the demo UI (`demo_ui = True`), also confirm that
  `infernix-demo` is present; when it does not, confirm `infernix-demo` is absent
- confirm that `infernix kubectl get storageclass` shows only `infernix-manual`
- confirm routes with `infernix cluster status`
- inspect `./.data/runtime/publication.json` or `GET /api/publication` to confirm the routed
  publication contract matches `cluster status`
- inspect the real ConfigMap with `infernix kubectl get configmap infernix-demo-config -n platform -o yaml`

<!-- infernix:route-registry:cluster-bootstrap:start -->
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:<port>/harbor` checks the Harbor portal route.
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:<port>/harbor/api/v2.0/projects` checks the `/harbor/api -> /api` rewrite into the Harbor core service.
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:<port>/minio/console/browser` checks the `/minio/console -> /` rewrite into the MinIO console service.
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:<port>/minio/s3/models/demo.bin` checks the `/minio/s3 -> /` rewrite into the MinIO S3 service.
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:<port>/pulsar/admin/admin/v2/clusters` checks the `/pulsar/admin -> /` rewrite into Pulsar's `/admin/v2` surface.
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:<port>/pulsar/ws/v2/producer/public/default/demo` checks the `/pulsar/ws -> /ws` rewrite and returns `405 Method Not Allowed` on the real cluster path.
<!-- infernix:route-registry:cluster-bootstrap:end -->

## Teardown

- run `infernix cluster down`
- expect durable state under `./.data/` to remain intact
